# **Inventory Management System**

A simple **Inventory Management System** built with Java

## About The Project
There is big issue on inventory management systems nowadays. *They don't update with the current pricing.* Every time we add an item with different cost, the manager/the person in charge have to update the price manually. If there is less amount of newly added item the price adjustment is also another problem to consider.
This project will solve those issues by its own unique method.
