# **Inventory Management System**

A simple **Inventory Management System** built with Java that solves real-world pricing problems.

## About The Project
There is a big issue on inventory management systems nowadays. *They don't update with the current pricing automatically.* Every time we add an item with different cost, the manager/the person in charge have to update the price manually. When small amount of items are added, the price adjustment is also another problem to consider.
This project solves those issues by its own unique method.
